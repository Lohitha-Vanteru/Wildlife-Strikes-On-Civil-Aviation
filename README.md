# FAA Wildlife Strikes on Civial Aviation Analysis

## Introduction

This project explores the FAA Wildlife Strike Database, investigating the relationship between wildlife strikes and migratory patterns of various bird species, terrestrial mammals, and reptiles. The goal is to gain insights into the major causes of these strikes and propose measures to enhance aviation safety.

## Data Source

Data is sourced from the FAA Wildlife Strike Database: [FAA Wildlife Strike Database](https://wildlife.faa.gov/)

## Problem Statement

The increasing number of flights and airports poses a significant threat to birdlife, leading to wildlife strikes. These incidents not only cause operational disruptions but also result in substantial financial losses for airlines. This project aims to analyze historical wildlife strike data and identify trends, contributing factors, and potential preventive measures.

## Project Scope

- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Identify and filter out bad data.
  - Handle null or missing values.

- **Wildlife Species Analysis:**
  - Explore the species involved in strikes.
  - Analyze the impact of wildlife strikes on aviation.

- **Bird Analysis:**
  - Investigate bird species types, migration patterns, and traits.
  - Perform outlier analysis.

- **Geographical Analysis:**
  - Analyze bird strikes by state, region, and altitude.
  - Examine the correlation between strikes and weather conditions.

- **Data Transformation:**
  - Reformat and organize data for visualizations.

- **Airport and Aircraft Analysis:**
  - Explore the impact on airports and aircraft damages.

- **Flight Phase and Time of Day Impact:**
  - Investigate the influence of flight phase and time of day on strikes.

- **Correlation Analysis:**
  - Check correlations and patterns in the data fields.

- **Economic Impact:**
  - Analyze economic losses attributed to wildlife strikes.

- **Human Safety Impact:**
  - Investigate the impact on human fatalities and injuries due to strikes.

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide valuable insights into wildlife strikes, aiding in making informed decisions to mitigate the risks associated with aviation and wildlife interactions.
